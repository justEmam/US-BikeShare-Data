This is my first python project after 4 weeks of the beginning of the learning process.


# Python Data Analysis Project with Pandas




## Description
<font size="5">The csv files contain the data for a bike share system for major cities in the United States,
* All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year</font>
_________________________________________________________________________________________

The program asks the user to enter a city,month,weekday   and slices the dataframe accordingly.

The program provides the following information:
#1 Popular times of travel
* most common month
* most common day of week
* most common hour of day


#2 Popular stations and trip
* most common start station
* most common end station
* most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#4 User info

* counts of each user type
* counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
* earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
